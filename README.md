# COVID-19 Data-Analysis and Modeling Platform
## Agent-Based Modeling of Urban vs Rural School Settings

This repository contains an HTML/JavaScript simulator that will model COVID-19 transmission in different environments (schools, transportation, etc.) and allows the user to compare infection spread within different environments. This is based on my initial research and project that was created in MATLAB, specifically [the COVID-19 School Transmission Model repository] (https://github.com/TarunNan/COVID-ABM-Model-and-Data-Analysis).
